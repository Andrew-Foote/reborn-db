an egg move can be inherited from either parent, as long as the parent knows the move
	so for each pokemon and egg move, we can have a page which is just a list of pokemon that are compatible with that pokemon, or an evolution of that pokemon,
	and can learn the move by some means

ooh, an egg move can be gained either from a pre-evolution or itself
