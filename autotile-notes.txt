an autotile image consists of a number of sub-images,
laid out in a row. these sub-images correspond to stages
of an animation. each sub-image is 96 pixels wide and
128 pixels high.

the sub-image can be divided in 32 x 32 tiles. The middle
tile on the top row is always blank. The left tile on the
top row is used as a selection icon in the RPG Maker UI and
otherwise does nothing.

The right tile on the top row is divided into four 16 x 16
units. Each one is used for a corner where the diagonally
adjacent tile is not the autotile, but the two directly adjacent
tiles are.

As for the remaining 96 x 96 portion of the sub-image, the
middle 32 x 32 tile is used for a tile completely surrounded
by the same autotile. The edge tiles are split into 16 x 16
units like the top right tile and work in a similar way.

Overall there are 48 possible combinations:
1. no directly adjacent brothers---will be pieced together from the
   four corners of the bottom segement.
2. only directly adjacent brother at top---will be pieced together
   from the

Some autotiles seem to have a different format where the height of the
image is only 32; these are simply rows of tiles.
