TODO LIST (roughly sorted by priority)

- Add a "tile" table, to store each individual tile (useful for linking with "event_page_tile")
- Split out map image generating stuff from map_data.py
- Make encounters page nicer (e.g. allow grouping by Pokémon, collapsing levels)
- Parse map events for item locations
- Parse map events for trainer locations
- Add info to event encounters about location on the map + required switches/variables/etc.
- Display wild Pokémon movesets on map pages [done], maybe also highlight Field Effect-changing moves where relevant (e.g. Noivern/Tailwind in Chrysolia Spring Sauna)
- Egg move parents
- Info about how to change between forms (already done for Mega Evolutions)
- Parse settings for rayquaza info, etc.
- Add panoramas to map pictures
- FIgure out how autotiles work and use that to improve the map pictures
- Put event commands in the database
- Find out what determines the order of trainers in the debug menu, since it seems to be different from the pbs_order
- Formulate and test a build process
- Rename reborn/script.py to multiple_forms_script.py or something
- Make event encounter script able to parse more complex conditions (e.g. the egg gift in Rhodochrine Jungle)
  - should be done, though it's quite likely there'll still be some stuff missing
- Clear up all the tons of dead code in this project
    - mostly done, maybe still a bit left that i'm indecisive about
- We need a Ctrl+Fable extract of all event scripts (Event YEET script?)
    - I found the game's event text dump functionality (accessible via debug) so this isn't really needed

MAYBE:

- Fix Pokémon with one regular ability / one Hidden Ability being displayed as if they have two regular abilities (though, seems like this is just how it is in the PBS files? I don't think the regular/hidden distinction actually has any relevance in Reborn anyway)
  - Yep, checked in-game, if you use an ability capsule on Raikou with Pressure you don't see the "(H)" after Inner Focus. So this is accurate, just an instance where Essentials/Reborn is slightly different (albeit not meaningfully different) from the official games
- Figure out how Hidden Power works for trainer Pokémon. Is it really just random?
- OK, I think the time has come to start identifying which parts of the DB/site we need to regenerate rather than just regenerating everything with every change
  - nah, it's ok for a while longer
- The whole evolution requirements stuff should be redone. Sometimes EAV is what you need
  - nah, think it's ok now
- Shouldn't the Peridot Ward Joltik have Cross Poison as an egg move?
  - Nope, wiki is wrong here, there is an entry for it in PokemonEncounterModifiers, using 32 as the WildMod value, but WildMod actually never gets set to 32, so it doesn't happen. also verified with my save file, i got joltik through the event and no cross poison. devs probably forgot to set the WildMOd?
