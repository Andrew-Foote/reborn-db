TODO LIST

- Fix marshal parser's issues with cyclic refs
- Parse map events for item locations
- Parse map events for trainer locations
- Extract Battle Tower info (btpokemon.txt)
- Display info about trainer sets, Battle Tower sets on Pokémon page, to give reader an idea of possible movesets; maybe also some kind of "moveset builder"
- Display wild Pokémon movesets on map pages, maybe highlight Field Effect-changing moves where relevant (e.g. Noivern/Tailwind in Chrysolia Spring Sauna)
- Info about how to change between forms (already done for Mega Evolutions)
