TODO LIST

- Bag pocket names in items table should reflect the names given in Settings.rb (pbPocketNames)
- Rename reborn/script.py to multiple_forms_script.py or something
- Parse settings for rayquaza info, etc.

- Parse map events for item locations
- Parse map events for trainer locations
- Extract Battle Tower info (btpokemon.txt)
- Display info about trainer sets, Battle Tower sets on Pokémon page, to give reader an idea of possible movesets; maybe also some kind of "moveset builder"
- Display wild Pokémon movesets on map pages, maybe highlight Field Effect-changing moves where relevant (e.g. Noivern/Tailwind in Chrysolia Spring Sauna)
- Info about how to change between forms (already done for Mega Evolutions)
- Have a way to identify forms as "battle only" (so we don't show e.g. that Mega-Lucario eggs hatch into Mega-Lucario)
- Make encounters page nicer (e.g. allow grouping by Pokémon, collapsing levels)
- Formulate and test a build process
- Missing event enccounters:
    - Rayquaza, Riolu, probably more
- FIgure out how autotiles work and use that to improve the map pictures
- Add panoramas to map pictures
- Make event encounters script map work again
- Egg move parents

MAYBE:

- Fix Pokémon with one regular ability / one Hidden Ability being displayed as if they have two regular abilities (though, seems like this is just how it is in the PBS files? I don't think the regular/hidden distinction actually has any relevance in Reborn anyway)
  - Yep, checked in-game, if you use an ability capsule on Raikou with Pressure you don't see the "(H)" after Inner Focus. So this is accurate, just an instance where Essentials/Reborn is slightly different (albeit not meaningfully different) from the official games
- Figure out how Hidden Power works for trainer Pokémon. Is it really just random?
- Make the ordering of evolution areas consistent, so it's not changing every time we do an unrelated change to the site
    i think it is already?
- OK, I think the time has come to start identifying which parts of the DB/site we need to regenerate rather than just regenerating everything with every change
- The whole evolution requirements stuff should be redone. Sometimes EAV is what you need
