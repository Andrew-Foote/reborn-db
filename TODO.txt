TODO LIST

- Fix marshal parser's issues with cyclic refs
- Parse map events for item locations
- Parse map events for trainer locations
- Extract Battle Tower info (btpokemon.txt)
- Display info about trainer sets, Battle Tower sets on Pokémon page, to give reader an idea of possible movesets; maybe also some kind of "moveset builder"
- Display wild Pokémon movesets on map pages, maybe highlight Field Effect-changing moves where relevant (e.g. Noivern/Tailwind in Chrysolia Spring Sauna)
- Info about how to change between forms (already done for Mega Evolutions)
- Have a way to identify forms as "battle only" (so we don't show e.g. that Mega-Lucario eggs hatch into Mega-Lucario)
- Make encounters page nicer (e.g. allow grouping by Pokémon, collapsing levels)

MAYBE:

- Fix Pokémon with one regular ability / one Hidden Ability being displayed as if they have two regular abilities (though, seems like this is just how it is in the PBS files? I don't think the regular/hidden distinction actually has any relevance in Reborn anyway)
- Figure out how Hidden Power works for trainer Pokémon. Is it really just random?
