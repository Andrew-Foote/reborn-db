get_evolution_root simply walks the ancestors of a given pokemon using the pokemon_evolution_method and returns the last one. or if it doesn't find any ancestors, it looks for descendants and returns the original pokemon if there are descendants, None otherwise.

the evolution diagram macro takes a pokemon and a tree
the tree structure is

{ root: {id: <pkmn_id>, name: <pkmn_name>, form: <pkmn_form_name>},
  branches: [
  	{ methods: [ <method desc>, ...], result: <subtree> }
  	{ methods: ..., result: ... },
  	...
  ]

  }



TASK 1
We want a table "pokemon_evolution_base" with columns "pokemon" and "base", mapping each pokemon <s>that's part of an evo family</s> to the initial pokemon in the evolution chain.

Idea:
First we select each pokemon along with itself (its 0th ancestor), and the index 0.
Then at the nth stage, we select the immediate ancestors of all rows that have index n, if they have one.

done, we have our view "pokemon_evolution_stage". the "base" table would be:

select "evolution" as "pokemon", "pokemon" as "base" from "pokemon_evolution_stage"

(just a slight change of perspective)

TASK 2:

Now, for each base Pokémon (which we can now trivially map any Pokémon to), we need to be able to construct the evo tree
